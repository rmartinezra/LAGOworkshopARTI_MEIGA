## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install Docker
Follow the instructions in [`docker_install.txt`](docker_install.txt) to install Docker and configure your environment.

### 2. Run ARTI in a container
Use the guide in [`arti.txt`](arti.txt) to:
- Pull the ARTI container.
- Mount a local folder for input/output.
- Run simulations of cosmic-ray showers.

### 3. Process Simulation Data
The provided Python scripts allow you to analyze and visualize the ARTI outputs:

```bash
python3 EAS3d.py   # 3D visualization of showers
python3 EASsec.py  # Process secondary particle data
python3 EAStime.py # Analyze time distribution
